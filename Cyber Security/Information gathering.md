# Information Gathering
[Back to Cyber security page](Cyber%20security.md)

### Why?
- Information gathering gives bigger surface for attacks and helps to find vulnerable systems easily.

### Subdomain Enumeration
- subdomains may have outdated or buggy software which can help us to get access to main domain
- Forgotten subdomain are rarely maintained so chances of being easy targets.

### How to find ?
- Google things like ```site : example.com```
- virustotal.com 
- dnsdumpster.com
- crt.sh
- sublist3r tool
	- ```sublist3r  -d google.com```
- amass
	- ```amass -d google.com```
