## What is metasploit?
The **Metasploit** Project is a computer security project that provides information about security vulnerabilities and aids in penetration testing and IDS signature development. It is owned by Boston, Massachusetts-based security company Rapid7.

Its best-known sub-project is the open-source Metasploit Framework, a tool for developing and executing exploit code against a remote target machine. Other important sub-projects include the Opcode Database, shellcode archive and related research.

The Metasploit Project includes anti-forensic and evasion tools, some of which are built into the Metasploit Framework. Metasploit is pre-installed in the Kali Linux operating system. - Wikipedia 

The [Metasploit Framework](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework) (MSF) is far more than just a collection of exploitsâ€“it is also a solid foundation that you can build upon and easily customize to meet your needs.
