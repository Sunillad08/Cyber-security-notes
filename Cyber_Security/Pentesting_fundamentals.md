## What is pentest?
A Penetration test or pentest is an ethically-driven attempt to test and analyse the security defences to protect these assets and pieces of information. A penetration test involves using the same tools, techniques, and methodologies that someone with malicious intent would use and is similar to an audit.

## Rules of Engagement (ROE)
The ROE is a document that is created at the initial stages of a penetration testing engagement.
- Permission
This section of the document gives explicit permission for the engagement to be carried out. This permission is essential to legally protect individuals and organisations for the activities they carry out.

- Test Scope
This section of the document will annotate specific targets to which the engagement should apply. For example, the penetration test may only apply to certain servers or applications but not the entire network.

- Rules
The rules section will define exactly the techniques that are permitted during the engagement. For example, the rules may specifically state that techniques such as phishing attacks are prohibited, but MITM (Man-in-the-Middle) attacks are okay.

## Pentesting methodology
General pentesting should follow steps like this

| Stage |Description |
|:-:|:--|
|Information Gathering|This stage involves collecting as much publically accessible information about a target/organisation as possible, for example, OSINT and research.|
|Enumeration/Scanning|This stage involves discovering applications and services running on the systems. For example, finding a web server that may be potentially vulnerable.|
|Exploitation|This stage involves leveraging vulnerabilities discovered on a system or application. This stage can involve the use of public exploits or exploiting application logic.|
|Privilege Escalation|Once you have successfully exploited a system or application (known as a foothold), this stage is the attempt to expand your access to a system. You can escalate horizontally and vertically, where horizontally is accessing another account of the same permission group (i.e. another user), whereas vertically is that of another permission group (i.e. an administrator).|
|Post-exploitation|This stage involves a few sub-stages:What other hosts can be targeted (pivoting), What additional information can we gather from the host now that we are a privileged user,Covering your tracks,Reporting|

There are many more techniques such as OSSTMM for networks , [OWASP](OWASP.md) for web testing and many more.
