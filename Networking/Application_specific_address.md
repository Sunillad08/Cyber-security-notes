## What is Application Specific Address ?
Some applications have user-friendly addresses that are designed for that specific application. Examples include the e-mail address , Universal Resource Locator (URL) . The first defines the recipient of an e-mail; the second is used to find a document on the World Wide Web. These addresses, however, get changed to the corresponding port and logical addresses by the sending computer.
