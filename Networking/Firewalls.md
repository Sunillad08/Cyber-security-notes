Types of firewalls
1. Packet filtering firewalls
	- Checks sender's & recievers IP address and port number
	- Rules are written in access control list
	- Does not check payload in packet
	-  Low security but cheaper
2. Application / Proxy firewall
	- Proxy firewalls hides devices behind firewall
	- Proxy is in middle of communication
	- Web server only know proxy request
	- Also checks payload
	- Slower than Packer filtering
3. Hybrid firewalls
	- Application firewall followed by packet filtering firewall
	- Most secure as best of both world
	- Used in mostly high security environments
