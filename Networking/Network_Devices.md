## Hub
- Connects all Internal devices
- Not so smart , transmitts packets to all connected devices
- unnecessary traffic and wasting bandwidth
- Works on Physical layer
- No more used

## Repeater
- Receives and retransmits signals
- Used for extending range , improving speed
- Mainly used in wireless but wired use too

## Bridge
- Intelligent repeater
- Works as network bridging 
- Works on data link layer
- Keeps log of MAC address
- Passes packets based on MAC address and where device is located

## Switch
- Connects all Internal devices
- Smart , transmitts packets to only destination device
- Used in internal communication
- Works on Physical layer
- Keeps record of MAC address of devices
- Used in LAN to create network
- Effiecient at connecting devices

## NIC
- For more Info check [NIC](NIC.md)

---

## Router
- Router is used for routing
- Use to connect to Internet
- Can decide if packets goes in internal network or outside network
- Used to connect networks
- Can be used for wireless connection
- Have in-built switch properties

## Gateways
-  Works like router 
-  Used to connect networks which uses different protocols
-  provide translation services

---

## Wireless access point (WAP)
- Basically routers with wireless connectivity 

---

## Modem
- Converts data from analog to digital and vice-versa
- Used to modulate and demodulate
- Need high speed conversion
