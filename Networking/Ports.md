- Physical connections

#### Virtual Ports : 
- Virtual ports are there to get access to data for particular application
- logical connection to exchange data
- Ports can be open , closed  | *note : filtered(not sure state)*
- Ports provide particular service
-   From 0 to 1023 – well known ports assigned to common protocols and services
-   From 1024 to 49151 – registered ports assigned by ICANN to a specific service
-   From 49152 to 65 535 – dynamic (private, high) ports range from 49,152 to 65,535. Can be used by any service on an ad hoc basis. Ports are assigned when a session is established, and released when the session ends.
