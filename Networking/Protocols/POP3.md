## What is POP3?
In computing, the **Post Office Protocol** (POP) is an application-layer Internet standard protocol used by e-mail clients to retrieve e-mail from a mail server. POP version 3 (POP3) is the version in common use.

Only Inbox emails. No synchronisation. No copy is kept if downloaded once.
Better for single device usage. Can view downloaded emails even if offline.
[IMAP](IMAP.md) is much better for real world usage.

It uses port 110 with TCP.
POP has 3 phases :
1. Authorization
2. Transaction
3. Update
