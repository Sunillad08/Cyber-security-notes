## What is SSH?
**Secure Shell**
Secure Shell (SSH) is a cryptographic network protocol for operating network services securely over an unsecured network. Typical applications include remote command-line, login, and remote command execution, but any network service can be secured with SSH.

Port 22 is used.

## Why SSH is used?
SSH provides a secure channel over an unsecured network by using a clientâ€“server architecture, connecting an SSH client application with an SSH server. The protocol specification distinguishes between two major versions, referred to as SSH-1 and SSH-2. The standard TCP port for SSH is 22. SSH is generally used to access Unix-like operating systems, but it can also be used on Microsoft Windows. Windows 10 uses OpenSSH as its default SSH client and SSH server.

## About SSH
SSH was designed as a replacement for [Telnet](Telnet.md) and for unsecured remote shell protocols such as the Berkeley rsh and the related rlogin and rexec protocols. Those protocols send sensitive information, notably passwords, in plaintext, rendering them susceptible to interception and disclosure using packet analysis. The encryption used by SSH is intended to provide confidentiality and integrity of data over an unsecured network, such as the Internet.

## How to setup SSH?
On Linux
```bash
sudo apt-get install openssh-client
systemctl status enable ssh.service # to check if running or not
systemctl start start ssh.service # start / enable depending of version
```
