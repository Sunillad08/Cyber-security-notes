## What is TLS?
**Transport Layer Security**
Transport Layer Security (TLS), the successor of the now-deprecated Secure Sockets Layer [SSL](SSL.md) is a cryptographic protocol designed to provide communications security over a computer network. The protocol is widely used in applications such as email, instant messaging, and voice over IP, but its use as the Security layer in [HTTPS](HTTPS.md) remains the most publicly visible.

Certificate cheking is key component.
